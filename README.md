# TessOCR
## Introduction
A lightweight and cross-platform compatible desktop OCR tool. This tool is developed with an easy-to-use and functional GUI, which is based on Tkinter, and the logic is written in Python. Tesseract OCR is the open-source OCR engine utilized to develop this tool. It can be used for optical character recognition of any image containing characters upto a sufficiently high degree of accuracy.


## Objective
The lack of an OCR tool native to Personal Computers was a major reason of why I decided to try to make an OCR tool that could provide results good enough, that the tool could be usable and introduced in people's workflows. Another reason for making this, was a recent introduction to the Image Processing and Computer Vision capabilities of Python.


## Requirements
- Tesseract OCR engine
- numpy
- cv2
- matplotlib
- tkinter
